# Auction Service

This is a full stack application for a live auction.
A user can log in using Auth0. Then they are directed to a landing page for the auction. 
A user can create an auction with a name and attach an image of the item.
Then other users of the application can place bids on the items. 
The winner of the auction (highest bidder when auction closes) as well as the seller will recieve an email. 

The website is hosted with Netlify.
